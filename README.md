# Welcome to Kotodama!

This repo will be rendered kotodama.github.io (hopefully)

# Purpose
In the long scheme of things, this will be my prototype website.
As of now, it will primarily be used as a intro-to-me kind of site.

# Scope
This website will be using React as part of my efforts to learn it.  I heard it was easy, so... hey, whatsup?

## Functionality
 - Nothing in particular
 
## Views/Sections/Whatever
 - Basic Intro to who I am and and what kind of things I've done (Almost like a resume)
 - Showcase my small projects, completed or not
 - Link to my social networks (??? do I even use them ???)

### More details to come...
